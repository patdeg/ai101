# AI 101 Exercises

Welcome to the hands-on exercises! These challenges help you deepen your understanding of AI APIs through experimentation.

## About These Exercises

Each exercise follows modern educational principles:
- **Progressive difficulty** - Start simple, build complexity
- **Hands-on experimentation** - Learn by doing
- **Real-world applications** - Build practical tools
- **Reflection prompts** - Understand the "why" behind results

## Exercise Structure

Each example has its own exercise file with challenges ranging from basic parameter tweaking to building complete applications.

## How to Use These Exercises

1. **Start with what interests you** - Don't feel obligated to go in order
2. **Document your findings** - Keep notes or a spreadsheet
3. **Experiment freely** - Try variations beyond what's suggested
4. **Share discoveries** - Document cool findings for others
5. **Combine concepts** - Mix exercises from different examples

## Learning Path

**Beginner:** Start with exercises 1-3 to understand API basics, then move to practical applications.

**Intermediate:** Focus on exercises 4-6 to learn content safety and security.

**Advanced:** Build complete applications combining multiple examples.

## Prerequisites

- Complete the basic examples in your language of choice ([bash/](../bash/), [nodejs/](../nodejs/), [python/](../python/), [go/](../go/))
- Have your `DEMETERICS_API_KEY` environment variable set
- Basic understanding of JSON and API requests

## Educational Philosophy

These exercises follow:
- **Bloom's Taxonomy** - Remember → Understand → Apply → Analyze → Evaluate → Create
- **Zone of Proximal Development** - Challenges are incrementally harder
- **Scaffolding** - Early exercises are guided, later ones require independence
- **Active Learning** - Predict before observing, reflect on results
