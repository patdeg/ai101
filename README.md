## Learning Path

1. **Start with Example 1** - Understand basic API calls
2. **Move to Example 2** - Learn how system prompts work
3. **Try Example 3** - See multimodal AI (vision) in action
4. **Explore Examples 4 & 5** - Understand AI safety tools (text + images)
5. **Try Example 6** - Learn about prompt injection detection
6. **Try Example 7** - Transcribe audio with Whisper

## Common Issues

**"Unauthorized" error:**
- Check your API key is set: `echo $DEMETERICS_API_KEY`
- Make sure you exported it in your current shell

**"Model not found" error:**
- Copy model names exactly (they're case-sensitive)
- Check https://console.groq.com/docs/models for current models

**Image too large:**
- Resize images before encoding
- Use JPEG format for smaller file sizes
- Base64 encoding increases size by ~33%

**Audio file issues:**
- Max audio file size: 25 MB
- Supported formats: mp3, wav, m4a, flac, ogg, webm
- Cost is based on audio duration, not file size
