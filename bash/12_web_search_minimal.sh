# Example 11 (Minimal): Web Search with groq/compound-mini
#
# What this demonstrates:
#   - Calling Groq's chat API with a web-search-capable model
#   - Minimal cURL-only request (raw JSON output)
#   - Environment variable authentication
#
# What you'll learn:
#   - How to invoke `groq/compound-mini` for questions needing fresh info
#   - How to structure a basic chat completion request
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - GROQ_API_KEY environment variable set
#   - curl installed
#
# Expected output:
#   - Raw JSON with the model's final answer in choices[0].message.content
#   - Optionally, extra fields like message.reasoning or executed tool info

  echo "Run: export GROQ_API_KEY=\"gsk_your_api_key_here\"" 1>&2
  exit 1
fi

# Minimal payload: Ask a question that typically requires web search.
# Note: groq/compound-mini has built-in web search; the model will decide
# when to call it. No special tool config is required for this minimal demo.

# Exercises (edit this file and re-run):
# 1) Change the question to something location-specific (e.g., in your country).
# 2) Try a more complex query using AND/OR wording (e.g., "ANNOUNCEMENTS AND (OpenAI OR Meta)").
# 3) Switch to the bigger model by changing model to "groq/compound".
# 4) For advanced control (include/exclude domains, country), see the full version script.

# Quick tip: see exercises for this example (printed to stderr to keep stdout JSON-only)
