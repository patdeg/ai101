# Example 12 (Minimal): Code Execution with openai/gpt-oss-20b
#
# What this demonstrates:
#   - Using a code-execution-capable model to run Python
#   - Minimal cURL request (raw JSON output)
#
# What you'll learn:
#   - How to send a task that is best solved by executing code
#   - How to ask the model to check for exceptions and mitigate them
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - GROQ_API_KEY environment variable set
#   - curl installed
#
# Expected output:
#   - Raw JSON containing the final answer and optional reasoning/tool info

# Exercises:
# 1) Change model to "openai/gpt-oss-120b" (if available) and compare results.
# 2) Ask the model to run code that might fail (e.g., parsing invalid JSON) and fix it.
# 3) Ask for the code snippet it actually executed and its outputs.

# Print exercises path to stderr to keep stdout JSON-only
