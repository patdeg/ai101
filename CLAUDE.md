# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is `ai101` - a learning repository organized by programming language and technology. The repository contains empty directories structured for multi-language examples and experiments.

## Directory Structure

- `curl/` - curl examples and scripts
- `go/` - Go language examples
- `nodejs/` - Node.js/JavaScript examples
- `python/` - Python examples

Each directory is intended to contain standalone examples demonstrating AI integration or usage patterns in that specific language/technology.

## Development Approach

When adding new examples to this repository:

1. Place files in the appropriate language/technology directory
2. Each example should be self-contained with its own dependencies
3. Include language-specific dependency files (package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, etc.) within each subdirectory as needed
